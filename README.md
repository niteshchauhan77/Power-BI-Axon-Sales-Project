# Power-BI-Axon-Sales-Project
# Problem Statement:
  A small company Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized 
  system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.
  To address this issue, the company has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) tool that can help them manage and analyze their sales data effectively.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to understand the sales data of Axon classic models and help the management understand the sales trend of classic models and distribution of sales over a period of three years among various different products from Axon Classic Models product Line. The project also should display relevant information in regards to different aspects which are impacting sales and how they can make changes in order to improve sales worldwide.
